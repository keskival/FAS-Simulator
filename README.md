# FAS Simulator
A modular benchmark simulator for flexible assembly systems.

Licence: WTFPL

This project includes a SimPy discrete event simulator simulating a plausible Flexible Assembly System
documented in the [documentation/FAS-Simulator.pdf](https://github.com/keskival/FAS-Simulator/raw/master/documentation/FAS-Simulator.pdf).

It contains several pre-configured scripts for different kinds of production runs, named: `run*.py`

Example: Running a simple simulation with a simulated wear and tear fault:
`./run_easy_with_fault.py`

Running the simulations produces output to the STDOUT, but the actual output is written as JSON to `output.json`.

The output contains a sequence of events with timestamps.

Additionally, there are several `*.m` files and `*.sh` files to create different kinds of visualizations
out of this JSON output using Octave and ffmepg.

The `data.mat` file is created using `./output_to_octave.py`
from `output.json` to `data.mat`.

There is also a related FAS-Tensorflow project that is an implementation that extracts process model
features from inputs
generated by this project using deep learning methods, and uses those for anomaly detection.

TODO: Should clean up the structure of this repository.
