        Netzob : Inferring Communication Protocols
        ==========================================
        
        About Netzob
        ============
        
        Functional Description
        -----------------------
        
        Netzob is an opensource tool for reverse engineering, traffic generation
        and fuzzing of communication protocols. This tool allows to infer the message format (vocabulary)
        and the state machine (grammar) of a protocol through passive and active processes.
        Its objective is to bring state of art academic researches to the operational field,
        by leveraging bio-informatic and grammatical inferring algorithms in a semi-automatic manner.
        
        Netzob is suitable for reversing network protocols, structured files and system and
        process flows (IPC and communication with drivers and devices).
        Dedicated modules are provided to capture and import data in multiple contexts (network, file and process data acquisition).
        Once inferred, a protocol model can afterward be exported to third party tools (Peach, Scapy, Wireshark, etc.)
        or used in the traffic generation engine, to allow simulation of realistic and controllable communication endpoints and flows.
        
        Netzob handles different types of protocols: text protocols (like HTTP and IRC), delimiter-based protocols,
        fixed fields protocols (like IP and TCP) and variable-length fields protocols (like TLV-based protocols).
        
        Technical Description
        ---------------------
        
        Netzob's source code is mostly made of Python (90%) with some specific
        extensions in C (6%). It includes a graphical interface based on GTK3.
        
        The tool is made of a core (officially maintained) and of bunch of
        plugins (exporters, importers, ...). Some plugins are provided by the team while others are
        created and managed directly by users.

        Get Started with Netzob
        =======================
        
        Install it
        ----------
        
        There are two main ways of installing Netzob. The first one is based on
        per-OS installers while the other one is more 'pythonic'.
        
        We recommend the per-OS installers for 'normal' users while
        testers, developers and python experts might prefer the 'pythonic' way.
        
        Per-OS Installers:
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Please follow the specification documentations for each supported platform:
        
        :Debian/Ubuntu: `Installation documentation on Debian (wiki) <https://dev.netzob.org/projects/netzob/wiki/Installation_documentation_on_Debian>`_
        :Gentoo: `Installation documentation on Gentoo (wiki) <https://dev.netzob.org/projects/netzob/wiki/Installation_documentation_on_Gentoo>`_
        
        Pythonic Installer:
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        As a 'classic' python project, Netzob is provided with its
        ``setup.py``. This file defines what and how to install the project on a
        python hosting OS.
        
        This file depends on ``setuptools`` which like few other modules cannot be
        automatically installed. The reason why, you have to manually install the
        following bunch of prerequisites before initiating Netzob's install process.
        
        * python
        * python-dev
        * python-impacket
        * libxml2-dev
        * libxslt-dev
        * python-setuptools
        * python-gi
        * gir1.2-gtk-3.0, gir1.2-glib-2.0, gir1.2-gdkpixbuf-2.0, gir1.2-pango-1.0
        * libgtk-3-0
        * graphviz
        
        We also highly recommend to install the following additional dependencies:
        
        * python-babel (for the translations)
        * python-sphinx (for the documentation)
        
        Once the required dependencies are installed, you can test Netzob in
        developer mode::
        
          python setup.py build
          python setup.py develop --user
        
        Otherwise, if you want to install Netzob on the system::
        
          python setup.py build
          python setup.py develop
          python setup.py install
        
        Start it
        --------
        
        Once installed, running Netzob is as simple as executing the provided script::
        
          $ ./netzob
        
        This script is in Python's path if you've installed Netzob, otherwise
        (in developer mode), it's located in the top distribution directory.
        
        
        Miscellaneous
        -------------
        
        Configuration requirements for Network and PCAP input::
        
        *Note: Capturing data from network interfaces often requires admin privileges. Before we provide a cleaner and secure way (see issue 425 on the bugtracker for updated information - https://dev.netzob.org/issues/425), a possible HACK is to provide additionnal capabilities to the python binary.* ::
        
          $ sudo setcap cap_net_raw=ep /usr/bin/python2.XX
        
        Configuration requirements for IPC input on Ubuntu::
        
          $ sudo bash -c "echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope"
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        The folder ``doc/documentation`` contains all the documentation of Netzob.
        
        The user manual can be generated based on RST sources located in folder
        ``doc/documentation/source`` with the following command::
        
          $ sphinx-build -b html doc/documentation/source/ doc/documentation/build/
